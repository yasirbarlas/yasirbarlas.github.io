title: "Dual network structure of the AV node"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/av-node
excerpt: 'Biological systems, particularly the brain, are frequently analyzed as networks, conveying
mechanistic insights into their function and pathophysiology. This is the first study of a functional network
of cardiac tissue. We use calcium imaging to obtain two functional networks in a subsidiary but essential
pacemaker of the heart, the atrioventricular node (AVN). The AVN is a small cellular structure with dual
functions: a) to delay the pacemaker signal passing from the sinoatrial node (SAN) to the ventricles, and
b) to serve as a back-up pacemaker should the primary SAN pacemaker fail. Failure of the AVN can lead
to syncope and death. We found that the shortest path lengths and clustering coefficients of the AVN
are remarkably similar to those of the brain. The network is “small-world,” thus optimized for energy
use vs transmission efficiency. We further study the network properties of AVN tissue with knock-out of
the sodium-calcium exchange transporter. In this case, the average shortest path-lengths remained nearly
unchanged showing network resilience, while the clustering coefficient was somewhat reduced, similar to
schizophrenia in brain networks. When we removed the global action potential using principal component
analysis (PCA) in wild-type model, the network lost its “small-world” characteristics with less information passing efficiency due 
to longer shortest path lengths but more robust signal propagation resulting from higher clustering. 
These two wild-type networks (with and without global action potential) may correspond to fast and slow conduction pathways. 
Lastly, a one-parameter non-linear preferential attachment model is a good fit to all three AVN networks.'
