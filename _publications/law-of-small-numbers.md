title: "An investigation into the law of small numbers using R"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/law-of-small-numbers
excerpt: 'The Law of Small Numbers states that the Binomial distribution converges to the
Poisson distribution. Using the programming language R, we investigate the total
variation distance between Binomial(n, c/n) and Poisson(c) when we fix c and n
individually. We also look at the asymptotics for nd<sub>TV</sub> for a fixed c, where nd<sub>TV</sub> is the
total variation distance d<sub>TV</sub> multiplied by increasing values of n. Several properties of
d<sub>TV</sub> are looked at in this paper.'

The Law of Small Numbers states that the Binomial distribution converges to the
Poisson distribution. Using the programming language R, we investigate the total
variation distance between Binomial(n, c/n) and Poisson(c) when we fix c and n
individually. We also look at the asymptotics for nd<sub>TV</sub> for a fixed c, where nd<sub>TV</sub> is the
total variation distance d<sub>TV</sub> multiplied by increasing values of n. Several properties of
d<sub>TV</sub> are looked at in this paper.
