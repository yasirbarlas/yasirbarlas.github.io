I am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at City, University of London. The degree emphasises a strong focus on deep and reinforcement learning.

Prior to my master's degree, I graduated with a BSc Mathematics degree at Queen Mary, University of London. My mathematics degree was tailored towards statistics and machine learning, further details can be found in the Education section.

My interests lie in the fields of probability, statistics, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.
