I am a PhD student at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in Computer Science (and Statistics), supervised by [Professor Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/). I am also a student on the [ELLIS PhD programme](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), co-supervised by [Dr. Frans A. Oliehoek](https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/) at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Other co-supervisors at Manchester include [Dr. Sabina Sloman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eRBM_UcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mingfei Sun](https://mingfeisun.github.io/). I work on the combined areas of (Bayesian) experimental design and reinforcement learning, with a focus on building frameworks with a human-in-the-loop and on improving out-of-distribution generalisation. 

My broad interests lie in the fields of statistics and reinforcement learning. I have slightly lighter interests in the wider area of the mathematical sciences, having previously worked on probability and network science (applied to biology). During my time in education, I have also worked on natural language processing and computer vision, and you can find examples of some of the projects I have worked on through my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yasirbarlas).

Before embarking on my PhD, I studied a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/) (soon to be City St George's) and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).
