I will soon join [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [ELLIS PhD programme](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) as a PhD student in Computer Science (and Statistics). I will work on the combined areas of (Bayesian) experimental design and reinforcement learning, with a focus on building frameworks with a human-in-the-loop and on improving out-of-distribution generalisation. 

My broad interests lie in the fields of statistics and reinforcement learning. I have slightly lighter interests in the wider area of the mathematical sciences, having previously worked on probability and network science (applied to biology). During my time in education, I have also worked on natural language processing and computer vision, and you can find examples of some of the projects I have worked on through my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yasirbarlas).

Before embarking on my PhD, I studied a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/) (soon to be City St George's) and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).
