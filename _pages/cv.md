Education

* BSc. in Mathematics, Queen Mary, University of London, 2023 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Summer 2021: Research Intern
  * Queen Mary, University of London
  * Research Area: The Law of Small Numbers states that the Binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distribution. Using the programming language R, we investigate the total  variation distance between
Binomial(n, c/n) and Poisson(c) when we fix c and n individually and we also look at the asymptotics for $nd_{TV}$ for a fixed c. A paper has been submitted to a journal for the project.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Dudley Stark
